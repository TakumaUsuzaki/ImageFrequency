Radiomics is a method that extracts features from medical images using data-characterization algorithms (Gillies et al., 2016). Radiomics have been developed based on the concept that medical images contain information that reflects underlying pathophysiology (Gillies et al., 2016). To derive the radiomic feature from a medical image, intensity levels, texture heterogeneity patterns, and shape of the lesion (Lambin et al., 2012). The potential of radiomics has been shown across multiple tumor types, including the brain, head and neck, cervix, and lung cancer tumors. Radiomic features extracted from MRI, PET, or CT images, were associated with several clinical outcomes, and hence, potentially provide complementary information for decision support in clinical practice (van Griethuysen et al., 2017). However, the character of the lesion is affected by the surrounding tissue. A lesion on the medical image should be characterized by the interrelation between the lesion and surrounding tissue as well as the property of the lesion itself (Lambin et al., 2012; Janiszewska, 2020; Hobbs et al., 2003). We introduce a new radiomics feature that quantitatively analyzes the interrelation between lesions and surrounding tissue focusing on the value change of rows and columns in a medical image.
